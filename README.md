# Hybrid Portfolio

A single-page portfolio website blending Charles Bruyerre's Hybrid Genre Framework with Tim Quirino's Sci-Fi Visual Narrative.

## Project Overview

This portfolio combines sci-fi and fantasy elements with modern web development techniques:

- 60% Sci-Fi (Dune-inspired interface mechanics)
- 40% Fantasy (Living document with animated glyphs)
- 3D particle emitter for "spice" effect

## Technical Features

- **WebGL Integration**: 3D volumetric planet with orbital moons
- **Particle System**: Interactive "spice" particles with collision detection
- **CSS Animations**: Living document effects with animated glyphs
- **Semantic HTML5**: Accessibility-focused structure
- **Responsive Design**: Grid-based layout with clamp() scaling
- **Performance Optimization**: 90+ Lighthouse score targeting

## Interactive Elements

- **Hero Section**: Volumetric planet render with orbital paths (2 moons minimum)
- **Projects Section**: Hover-activated holotable entries for portfolio pieces
- **Skills Section**: Animated progress rings with hybrid theme labels
- **Contact Section**: Quantum entanglement form styled as frequency modulator

## Narrative Elements

- **Dynamic CTA**: "Harness the Voice" button that changes based on planetary alignment
- **Scroll-triggered Lore**: Text entries from the "Imperial Design Archives"
- **Animated Glyphs**: Fantasy elements with pulsing, living document effects

## Development Workflow

This project was created using MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools and follows these execution steps:

1. Created directory structure
2. Developed semantic HTML5 structure
3. Applied CSS styling with variables and responsive design
4. Added JavaScript interactivity
5. Implemented progressive enhancements
6. Added performance optimizations

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Fallback modes for legacy browsers
- Accessibility considerations, including reduced motion preferences

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. No build tools required - vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
